# VDSOM
## Bayesian Variational Dynamical Self Organising Maps

VDSOM is a method for training Self-Organizing maps with an adaptative neighborhood radius.
The following animation shows the weights during training on the MNIST Fashion dataset.
This dataset was sorted by cloth type in order to simulate sampling from a non-stationary distribution.
